# Integral-field (3D) datacube analysis for a quasar-host merger system

![SINFONI H-band datacube](https://github.com/chetnaduggal/IFU-datacube-analysis/assets/67710398/85aeb7fe-adb3-45ae-8e2d-e0d86ea1ad63)

The code and results in this repository are part of an ongoing study of the host galaxy of quasar 3C 297. The observations were obtained (Cycle 97 program 097.B-0452(A); PI G. Tremblay) from the now-decomissioned SINFONI instrument on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile. 
The data are now in public domain and raw files are available [here](http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/eso/approved_runs/query?tel=UT4&prog_id=097.B-0452(A)&period=97&remarks=%20).
