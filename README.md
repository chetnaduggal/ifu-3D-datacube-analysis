# Integral-field (3D) datacube analysis for a quasar-host merger system

![SINFONI H-band datacube](https://github.com/chetnaduggal/IFU-datacube-analysis/assets/67710398/85aeb7fe-adb3-45ae-8e2d-e0d86ea1ad63)

The code and results in this repository are part of an ongoing study of the host galaxy of quasar 3C 297. The observations were obtained (Cycle 94 program 094.B-0494(A); PI G. Tremblay) from the now-decomissioned SINFONI instrument on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile. The data are now in public domain.
