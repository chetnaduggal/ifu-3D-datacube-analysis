# Integral-field (3D) datacube analysis for a quasar-host merger system

![SINFONI H-band datacube](https://github.com/chetnaduggal/IFU-datacube-analysis/assets/67710398/85aeb7fe-adb3-45ae-8e2d-e0d86ea1ad63)

The code and results in this repository are part of an ongoing study of the host galaxy of quasar 3C 297. The observations were obtained (Cycle 97 program 097.B-0452(A); PI G. Tremblay) from the now-decomissioned SINFONI instrument on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile. 
The data are now in public domain and the raw files are available [here](http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/eso/eso_archive_main/query?prog_id=097.B-0452(A)&max_rows_returned=10000).

### Data

H-band grating (1.45−1.85 μm)
The data were reduced using the standard ESO-SINFONI pipeline. After sky subtraction and wavelength calibration, the final co-added data cube has a spatial scale of 0.125′′ per pix. The field of view is 8′′ × 8′′. The angular resolution, as sampled by the point-spread function (PSF) from the standard star observations, is ∼0.4′′. At the target redshift, this translates to spatial resolution of ∼3 kpc.
